Working on stuff

### Starting my coding journey 😁

I work for a company that basically creates codes as a product, so for me to better do my job I need to _work_ on coding. 💻

My plan is to:
- [x] Start understanding Github by working thru their Quickstarts :octocat:
- [x] Start making document changes with my company
- [ ] Work through the CS50 Harvard class
